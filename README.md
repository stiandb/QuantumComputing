# QuantumComputing

1. Run main.py to run quantum phase estimation. .npy files will be generated
2. Run plot_results.py to produce figures from the .npy files for 4, 6 and 8 work qubits (n_work needs to be specified).
3. Run main2.py to print FCI results.


hamiltonian.py contains functions to create pairing hamiltonian.

qcPairingModel.py contains class to set up and measure quantum circuit for pairing hamiltonian.
