Scripts folder:
Run main.py to run quantum phase estimation. FCI eigenvalues for the same systems will be printed.

hamiltonian.py contains functions to create pairing hamiltonian.

qcPairingModel.py contains class to set up and measure quantum circuit for pairing hamiltonian.

properties.txt includes properties of IBM's Melbourne quantum computer. These properties are used by qcPairingModel.py to produce noisy results.
