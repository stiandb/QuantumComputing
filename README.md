# QuantumComputing

Scripts folder:

Run main.py to run quantum phase estimation and produce the Quantum Computing results in the project PDF. FCI eigenvalues for the same systems will be printed. The script is a tad time consuming to run.

hamiltonian.py contains functions to create FCI pairing hamiltonian.

qcPairingModel.py contains class to set up and measure quantum circuit for pairing hamiltonian.

properties.txt includes properties of IBM's Melbourne quantum computer. These properties are used by qcPairingModel.py to produce noisy results.
